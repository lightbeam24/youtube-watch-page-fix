# youtube-watch-page-fix

This is now discontinued. It still *sort of* works, but the method it uses could stop working any day now. I made CustomTube, a Firefox extension that does what this script did, and so much more.

----

A CSS stylesheet that removes some of the changes to the YouTube watch page that were implemented on May 9, 2022. It currently uses a temporary method to fully restore the old layout, but will continue to partially work even after this method is removed because of the other fixes included. 

It is available as a [Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/yt-watch-page-fix/). 

For non-Firefox users (or Firefox users who prefer), it is also available as a [userstyle (userstyles.world)](https://userstyles.world/style/4623/youtube-watch-page-fix), and a [userscript (greasyfork.org)](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/445015-youtube-watch-page-fix).
